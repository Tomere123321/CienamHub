## üìñ Project Description
This Cinema Management System is a **full-stack web application** designed to manage members, subscriptions, and movies for cinemas or private systems.

1. The system architecture is based on a **MERN stack** environment:
   - **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS for modern UI and responsive design.
   - **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API handling.
   - **Database**: MongoDB for all data management.
2. The backend provides RESTful APIs for managing movies, users, and subscriptions. It fetches data from **TVMaze** (movies) and **JSONPlaceholder** (members), ensuring real-time updates for external sources.
3. **Key Features**:
   - Secure authentication using **JWT**.
   - Password encryption with **Bcrypt**.
   - Fine-grained role-based access control via **permissions**.
   - Ability to manage movies, track subscriptions, and assign roles for admins.
4. **Integration with External Services**:
   - Fetch movies and members from external APIs on initialization.
5. **Modern development tools**:
   - **Vite** for faster builds and live reloading.
   - ESLint for maintaining consistent and high-quality code standards.
